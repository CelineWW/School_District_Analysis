# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis
Due to academic dishonesty, Thomas High School ninth graders' scores were replaced by NaN. School district files were reanalyzed to
compare the results, aiming to determine how these changes affected the overall analysis. The following analyses were covered:
1. Create data frames of district summary.
2. Create data frames of school summary.
3. Determine the top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate.
4. List the average math score for each grade level from each school.
5. List the average reading score for each grade level from each school.
6. Calculate the scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type
